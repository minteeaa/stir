### what is this
*audio filter/upmixer designed around vrchat usage*

vrchat has had a [lack of audio filter support](https://feedback.vrchat.com/sdk-bug-reports/p/proposal-for-fixing-audio-filters-eg-low-pass-support-for-avpro) for a few years, making systems like [ARC-DSP](https://www.patreon.com/Elevative) very appealing for better sounding audio used in music events

STIR started off as a server-hosted audio upmixer that applied simple audio filters separating the lows, mids, and highs of a stereo input and returned those in a channel setup usable within vrchat; it is now an OBS plugin

### usage
